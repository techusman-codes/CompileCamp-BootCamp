# 📋 Todo List App with Riverpod

This project is part of **Week 4** of the Complete Flutter Bootcamp.  
The goal is to demonstrate a solid understanding of **state management with Riverpod** by building a simple yet complete Todo List application.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This app allows users to:

- Add new todos
- Mark todos as completed or pending
- Delete todos
- Filter todos by status (All, Completed, Pending)

While simple in functionality, the project emphasizes **clean architecture**, **state management with Riverpod**, and **Flutter best practices**.

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Complete / Uncomplete Tasks**: Toggle the status of your tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove unwanted tasks.
- **Filter Tasks**: View All, Completed, or Pending tasks.
- **Responsive UI**: Works on different screen sizes.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The aim is **not** to create a production-level app but to **demonstrate mastery of Riverpod concepts**, such as:

- Providers (StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, etc.)
- State management for lists and filtering
- Immutable state updates
- Separation of concerns (logic vs UI)
